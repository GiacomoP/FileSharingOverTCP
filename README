File Sharing System over TCP

What is it?
-------------

This project contains a Server and a Client program.
The server creates a file sharing network in which
clients can share their files between each others.
I just wanted to emulate a peer to peer protocol,
don't expect anything too fancy anyway.

You'll find the source code and a compiled version
of both server and client programs. Compiled on
Linux CentOS 64-bit.

KNOWN ISSUES
-------------

The client sometimes can't make a successful
handshake with the server at the time of
establing a connection.
